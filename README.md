## Core Game Concept
The player can see and enter an ancient stone tower that appears as ruins to everyone else. Inside, the tower contains a magical area where someone is trapped within manifestations of their deepest wish. When the player rescues them, that person coincidentally appears in the village through seemingly natural means - they have no memory of the tower experience.
As the story unfolds, the connection between the tower's magic and the player's own journey of finding their place in the world becomes increasingly meaningful.
